A currency converter is a tool that allows you to convert the value of one currency into another currency.

Inputs:

Base currency: The currency that you want to convert from.
Target currency: The currency that you want to convert to.
Exchange rate: The current exchange rate between the base currency and the target currency.
Output:

The amount of the target currency that you would receive in exchange for the base currency.
Example:

Let's say you want to convert 100 US dollars (USD) into euros (EUR). The current exchange rate between USD and EUR is 0.95 EUR/USD. This means that you would receive 95 EUR in exchange for 100 USD.

Formula:

The formula for currency conversion is:

target_currency_amount = base_currency_amount * exchange_rate
In this formula, the following variables are used:

target_currency_amount: The amount of the target currency that you would receive in exchange for the base currency.
base_currency_amount: The amount of the base currency that you are converting.
exchange_rate: The current exchange rate between the base currency and the target currency.
Example:

Let's use the example from above to calculate the amount of EUR that you would receive in exchange for 100 USD. The exchange rate is 0.95 EUR/USD, so the formula would look like this:

target_currency_amount = 100 USD * 0.95 EUR/USD
The answer is 95 EUR. This means that you would receive 95 EUR in exchange for 100 USD.
